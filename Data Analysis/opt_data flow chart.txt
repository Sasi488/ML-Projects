Take the current datasets that are there with us and come up with optimizations for the analysis to be performed
     
step1- Take input from the user
     -->Load the dataset from specified file.

step2- Print the shape of the dataset
     -->Display the number of rows and columns in the dataset.

step3- Identify the data types
     -->Analyze the types of data in each column
        (Numerical, Categorical, mixed data)

step4- Statistical Analysis

step5- Divide the dataset by each column.

step6- Print the appropriate optimization based on dataset.
